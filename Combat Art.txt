Fundaments

Each character is presented with a set of basic commands that they can use, namely:

> Sword Slash
	Deals normal damage to a single target. 
	User gains 1 AP with an additional chance 
	based on the user's mastery to gain 1 more AP.
> Rifle Shot
	Deals normal damage that ignores resistance%.
	This will use up 1 AP or in this case, round
	in the clip.
> Reload
	Replenishes rifle's clip. This action, however,
	doubles WT.
> Anatomy
	Marks the target as 'anatomized. Holding 'Tab' 
	will reveal the current health and WT of 
	anatomized targets.
> Recuperate
	Gradually restores health by 1% of its maximum.
	Recuperating longer means more health will be 
	restored.
> First Aid
	Consumes 1 healing leaf to restores user's health 
	by 25% of its maximum. Can be accessed by pressing
	'Left CTRL'.
 

Wait Time

Wait Time (WT) is the time it takes for a character to prepare
to take an action. WT is governed by an attribute called speed and 
calculated as such: <WT = 100/SPEED>.
WT can be easily manipulated through the use of 'Recuperate', thus
you can use this to control the order of actions.
Needless to say, paying close note to units' WT is vital to 
achieve success in combat.
